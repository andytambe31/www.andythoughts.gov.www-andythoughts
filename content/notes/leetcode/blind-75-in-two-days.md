After nearly two weeks of trying to get back into the groove of studying DSA, I’m ready to take on the infamous Blind 75 challenge. That said, I want to make it clear that this task is quite ambitious and not suited for beginners. A strong foundation in OOP, control flow, data structures, and design patterns is essential before attempting it. Now that the disclaimer is out of the way, let’s dive into the challenge!

### Longest Consecutive Sequence

> Difficulty: Medium 

Given an unsorted array of integers `nums`, return the length of the longest consective elements sequence.

You must write an algorithm that runs in **O(n)**  time.

**Example 1:**
> Input: nums = [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2]
> Output: 4
> Explanation: The longest consective elements sequence is `1,2,3,4`. Therefor its length is 4.
